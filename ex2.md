1. Interpolation search can be better than binary search in certain scenarios due to the following aspects:

    - Adaptability to Uniformly Distributed Data:
        Binary search always examines the middle element. On the other hand, interpolation search estimates the probable position of the target element based on its value and the distribution of values in the array.This adaptability allows it to converge to the target position more quickly when the data is evenly spread.

    - Variable Step Size:
        Interpolation search uses a variable step size, adjusting its search space based on the values of the elements in the array. This kind of step size allows it to cover more ground efficiently when the values in the array are not evenly spaced. On the other hand, binary search always divides the search space in half, which might not be optimal.
